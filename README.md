# --> PROJECT-TOPIC : CARRIER-GUIDANCE SYSTEM

   Passing out of Graduation is a big time for most of the fresher graduates because for most it is the first time they will have to make a life-changing choice to build their carriers . This Online Career Guidance System aims to be a helpful and useful starting point for this confusing phase . There is a wealth of tools and data available for Fresher graduates who are interested in any field but most students do not have the time to research as well as required. This system will bring all these tools and data in one place for students as well as fresher graduates .

   The Online Career Guidance System begins with choosing a career. Students or freshers will be able to see various career choices . They will be able to view Carrier Opportunities , About any courses , Structured carrier path in a perticular course , some references for perticular topic in courses .  All this information will help future college students to make a well â€“ informed choice.

# Process :

Step-01 : 

    Run the Application , You will get the interface like this .

![01- First interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196245857-5af0821b-7d37-444d-a81d-9272936eaddd.png)

    We can also see our database is updated after running the application like Signup_Details and Contact_Us tables are created .
  
![02-View Database and tables created after run program](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196247282-9e052e76-7e63-4768-9139-61a6cd11a464.png)

     In signup process as a developer we add some regex concepts to validate some fields like Name and surname never be a single character , date of birth is in the form of dd-mm-yyyy , email-id must contain '@' symbol , phone number must be of 10 digits , password should contain the following requirements shown on applications .

    So after filling all the requirement details the signup process is successfully completed .

    Here 5 options are available i.e; About , Journey towards full stack java developer , Carrier opportunity , Self learning sites and back to carrier opportunity .

    In About section you can see that course Objective , details and what you learn in that course . Now in Journey towards full stack java developer section You will find exact carrier path i.e; what you need to learn , which topic you need to focus and what time you need to be invested in perticular topics .

![22- Back to Main Menu from carrier Opportunity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196346430-0f10c696-1f24-45f8-a678-7f5b9ccf3062.png)

Step-07 :

    Now in main menu you will find rest of the options like opt-2 for profile , opt-3 for contact-us , opt-4 for you query and opt-5 for logout

    So Now let say as a user we press 2 for profile section . 

![23- Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196351099-786e6c03-32ed-4138-ab3c-67445018177b.png)

    Now you can see 2 options i.e; your profile and update profile .

![25- Your Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196354676-eb2796e5-e985-4b7b-bb00-0c36a87a204b.png)

    Now we back to our main menu and then again by pressing opt-2 i.e; Profile we get again two options . So now we press opt-2 i.e; Update profile .

![26- Update Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196354942-2f5f078e-cb3f-4912-a637-d2f7c04e73b8.png)

    again you need to enter your contact number which you enter during signup process .

    1- First Name    			 

    2- Last Name

![27- Options in Update Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196357254-50204fc1-64a5-424e-b059-bd3545e15b66.png)

    Let say we need to update Email for an example so press opt-4 .

    Then you need to enter contact number which you enter during signup process . if you enter the correct Contact number then you need to enter the updated email-id .
    after completing this you can see the message as email is updated .

![28- Update Email](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196357458-e04dbd09-db32-4753-85ae-05ed3e318d20.png)

    Now you can see in database also when in email field you can observe that it is updated .

![29- View Updated Email On Database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196358100-9ed0ad06-a360-428a-bbc9-0c6704038a86.png)

Step-8 :
    
    Now if you have some query or doubt or you need some help during accessing this system then you can contact the developer and send your query . So for that in main menu you can press opt-3 i.e; Contact Us . 

![30- Contact Us](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196359024-4a28bab5-8e30-4856-948f-613cb54cfe6b.png)

    You need to provide details which they ask during Contact Us section but one important thing which you need to remember that during filling the details you must need to enter the contact number which you provide during signup process otherwise your query will not send to developer .

    So assume that you enter all the fields correctly .

![31- Query send to developer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196359549-a45288a4-a77e-476a-a1e5-9262705269d0.png)

    Now as a developer you can see the users query is updated in database .

![32- View user query by developer from database ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196360186-7bbcc502-8a7c-4819-a2b5-329d54413f42.png)

Step-9 : 

    Now as a user if we want to view our all query which we send during contact us then in main menu there is one option i.e; opt-4 (view your query) . So by pressing opt-4 we need to enter the contact number which you enter during signup process .


![33- View Your Query ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196372792-ec2f66ac-11a0-45e3-b3cd-8b12b981184c.png)

    After entering correct contact number you will get all the query which you send during contact us section . 

![34- Your Query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196373819-d7d5ab59-1364-48ad-8400-13fdcbfec7cf.png)

Step-10 :

Step-11 : 

    Now you are in login / signup page where 4 options are present out of which 2 options we explore 

    Now in case if you forgot username or password then there is one option present i.e; opt-3 in signup/login page  which help you to reset your username or password . so when you click opt-3 you will get interface like this .

![37- Forgot username and password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196377883-819def7a-4647-4662-a46c-ed19a9560fe0.png)

# J-Unit Testing :

We need to test our project to check where all the functionality of project is work properly or not . So for Testing our project we can use J-Unit 4  .

Simply for validation of our Contact number , Date of birth and Password we use J-Unit testing .

--> Contact Validation : 
            
    We need to check whether the contact we enter is validate by regex or not .
    we can use simple class where all the regex functionality is present .
    
   ![Test 01- Contact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108928939/196399601-21bc3fd3-f1f4-4155-8cd8-c1057c3d9c5d.png)
